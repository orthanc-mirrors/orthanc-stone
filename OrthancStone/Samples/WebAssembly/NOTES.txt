Building WebAssembly samples using Docker
=========================================

The script "./docker-build.sh" can be used to quickly build the
WebAssembly samples on any GNU/Linux distribution equipped with
Docker. This avoids newcomers to install Emscripten and learn the
CMake options. Just type:

$ ./docker-build.sh Release

After successful build, the binaries will be installed in the
following folder (i.e. in the folder "wasm-binaries" at the root of
the source distribution):

$ ls -l ../../wasm-binaries


NB: The source code of the Docker build environment can be found at
the following location:
