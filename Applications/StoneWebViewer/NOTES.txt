Differences with Osimis Web viewer
==================================

- The images are retrieved using DICOMweb.

- The Stone Web viewer uses the DICOM identifiers. The Osimis Web
  viewer the Orthanc identifiers.

  In the Stone Web viewer, the studies are indexed by their "Study
  Instance UID" tag (0020,000d). The series are indexed by their
  "Series Instance UID" tag (0020,000e). To open a single series,
  the parent study must be provided.

  To open a single study:
  http://.../index.html?study=<StudyInstanceUID>

  To open a single series:
  http://.../index.html?study=<StudyInstanceUID>&series=<SeriesInstanceUID>

- The "pickableStudyIds" parameter in the URL (to specify a list of
  studies to be displayed) is replaced by the single "study" GET
  argument, that is allowed to contain a comma-separated list of
  studies. The "series" parameter is ignored in this case.

  To open a list of studies:
  http://.../index.html?study=<StudyInstanceUID1>,<StudyInstanceUID2>,...
