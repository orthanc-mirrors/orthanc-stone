------------
Improvements
------------

* Internationalization (i18n). Some possible libraries:
  https://phrase.com/blog/posts/the-best-javascript-i18n-libraries/

* Configurable keyboard shortcuts. See Osimis Web viewer:
  https://bitbucket.org/osimis/osimis-webviewer-plugin/src/master/doc/default-configuration.json

* Flip X/Y : Should change the affine transformation of the 2D scene,
  not the texture. Flipping the texture makes the reference lines and
  crosshair invalid.


--------
Wishlist
--------

* Display video files even if the Orthanc REST API is not available
  (using pure DICOMweb). This could possible be done using the
  DICOMweb Bulk Data URI, and/or a dedicated JavaScript video player.

* "Start the Viewer with a specific Dicom file and display the
  specific images. For example I start the Viewer with dicomFile and
  open slide1, slide4, slide8, slide12 ?"

Optimizations
-------------

* Speedup RT-STRUCT projection in sagittal + coronal views
* Speedup RT-STRUCT loading


-----------------
Platform-specific
-----------------

* WebAssembly: Possible issue in "emscripten_set_timeout()" if the
  Oracle is destroyed while a sleep event is still being processed
  (the callback payload would be invalid). This is not a problem as
  long as the Oracle singleton is never destroyed. A cleaner solution
  would be similar to "WebAssemblyViewport::CreateObjectCookie()".

* Add precompiled headers for Microsoft Visual Studio
